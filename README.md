# macro-maker
This program makes macros, It was initially designed to automatically build houses in the sims until I realized I could make this both a macro maker/editor
as well as add functionality for the sims autobuilder.

everything in this is a mess and unusable except test 4 which is actuall the main file. The GUI and methods within that are my next planned update as they could use some revision

after the GUI is cleaned I will work on the logger since the logger is fairly one dimensional rn and wont work with mouse inputs very well, after the logger I will make the reader/parser

and after all of that I will make the controller. I plan to have all of this finished by jan 10th
