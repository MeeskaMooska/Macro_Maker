# macro-maker
This program makes macros, It was initially designed to automatically build houses in the sims until I realized I could make this both a macro maker/editor
as well as add functionality for the sims autobuilder.

If you're actually reading this congrats you're smarter than me I never read this stuff, also this is my first README ever so wish me luck on my first 
github thing!
